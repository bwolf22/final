            <p>College Park — Providing a fall break has been a yearly debate at the University of Maryland, but that
              debate might close as the school has discussed provisionary measures for implementing one.

            <p>On the UMD academic calendar, the school does not give students any days off from Labor Day until
              Thanksgiving, a continuous 12-week stretch of classes. Students feel that this long stretch intensifies
              their mental strain, making the fall semester more difficult.

          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>After conducting a poll of 100 students at UMD, the results showed that 55 percent of the survey
              respondents said that they performed better academically during the spring semester, which features a
              break, compared to the academic marathon in the fall semester.

            <p>“The three months without a break is a lot and gets tiring, and I think we need a break so students can
              be more mentally prepared for finals,” said freshman finance major Ryan Epstein. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>The University of Maryland Senate last discussed fall break in February. That meeting examined the
              calendar changes the school must make to provide time off. Since that meeting, the University Senate has
              initiated a discussion with the University System of Maryland Chancellor's office regarding the necessary
              schedule changes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>The spots that the school was considering placing the two days off were on the Monday and Tuesday before
              Thanksgiving, Election Day, or mid-October. Ultimately, mid-October was the best option to break up the
              semester.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>“The Monday/Tuesday before Thanksgiving is so late in the semester that it doesn't really accomplish the
              goal of providing stress relief in the middle of the term,” said Professor and Associate Provost Betsy
              Beise. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>The two days in October will be “no-class” days rather than university closures or holidays, so employees
              must report to work on those days.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>Despite the break not being a university closure, there are loopholes the faculty can use to enjoy the
              time off. “Employees on 12-month contracts accumulate administrative leave and could use that during those
              days,” said Beise. “Faculty on nine-month contracts do not accumulate leave, so they could not do so, but
              the break from delivering instruction would be a break for them.
              ”</p>

          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>With mental health concerns rising at UMD due to two on-campus suicides and spiking anxiety rates,
              according to the Diamondback and University Senate, students are pushing to have some extra time to
              decompress, spend time with friends and family, and get situated to close out the semester strong.</p>

          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>“I’m from South Florida, so I don’t get to go home and see my parents often,” said sophomore government
              and politics major Noah Kopelowitz. “So I would definitely use the fall break to catch up with my family
              and take a moment to appreciate things in life that aren’t academic based. ”

            <p>Of the 14 Big Ten Schools during the 2023-2024 academic year, UMD, Rutgers, Penn State, Michigan State,
              Illinois, Northwestern, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota do not provide a break during the fall semester.
              Ohio State, Michigan, Indiana, Purdue, and Nebraska give their students two days off in October.

            <p>While less than 50 percent of the Big Ten provides a fall Break, this differs for the Delaware, Maryland,
              and Virginia (DMV) schools. American University, George Washington University, Georgetown, and the
              University of Virginia are schools that provide a fall break in October. The University of Delaware
              cancels classes for Election Day at the beginning of November.

            <p>“It frustrates me when I know that all of my friends are at home hanging out with each other and their
              families while I’m sitting at my desk doing homework,” said Epstein.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p> To implement a fall break, the school must adhere to the state's instructional day requirement, adding
              two days to the academic calendar.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>“This is pretty disruptive, and it would mean starting earlier in the late summer and changing our summer
              session dates and, in some years, spring semesters,” said Beise. “The state regulations are more strict
              than the federal requirements, so one possible solution is to try to get the state regulations more
              flexible.”

          <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>The earliest UMD students and staff could see a fall break is the fall 2025 semester, and the school must
              make a final decision before the fall 2024 semester for that to happen.
